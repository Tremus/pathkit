    SkPaint controls options applied when drawing. SkPaint collects all
    options outside of the SkCanvas clip and SkCanvas matrix.

    Various options apply to strokes and fills, and images.

    SkPaint collects effects and filters that describe single-pass and multiple-pass
    algorithms that alter the drawing geometry, color, and transparency. For instance,
    SkPaint does not directly implement dashing or blur, but contains the objects that do so.
